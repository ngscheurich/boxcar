## Install

First make sure you have the following installed:

* Ruby 2.4.x
* PostgreSQL 9.6.x
* Node 6.10.x
* Yarn (or NPM)

After cloning the application and changing to its directory, you’ll want to run
the setup script:

```
% bin/setup
```

This will:

* Install application dependencies
* Create your database
* Install Spina CMS via an interactive prompt

You’ll want to select the `boxcar` theme during the Spina install (this
should be the default choice). You can modify or replace this theme later.

That’s all there is to it. Spin up a server on http://localhost:3000 and
start hacking:

```
% bin/rails server
```

## Overview

Boxcar is an opinionated collection of content management and software
development tools all bundled together and ready for you to start building
client sites on top of.

It’s powered by a some awesome open source projects:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), a web application framework
  that you may have heard of.
* [Spina](https://github.com/denkGroot/Spina), a lovely CMS for Rails that
  your clients can log into to manage parts of their website.
* [Breakfast](http://breakfast.devlocker.io/), a project that integrates
  modern JavaScript tooling (by way of [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)) into
  your Rails app.

There are a handful of useful Ruby libraries included; check the Gemfile
to see what’s what.

Boxcar also comes loaded with some frontend libraries set up and ready for
action:

* [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)

Finally, some tools are configured and in place to help check your work:

* [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

## Deployment

Boxcar can easily be deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), assuming
you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
installed.

First, run `bin/heroku_setup your-app-name`; this script will set you up with
two Heroku apps (one for staging and one for production) with Heroku
PostgreSQL instances attached and in a development pipeline.

From then on, you can `bin/deploy` to deploy to staging and `heroku
pipelines:promote -r staging` to promote the staging app to production.

## Contribute

PRs accepted, *however* this is an admittedly opinionated framework based
on what I use at [work](http://theadvocate.com) to get projects built
quickly and with a high level of confidence. If you’re looking to make big
changes to workflow or tooling you should fork the project.

Small note: If editing the README, please conform to the
[standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
specification.
