## Install

First make sure you have the following installed:

- Ruby 2.4.x
- PostgreSQL 9.6.x
- Node 6.10.x
- Yarn (or NPM)

After cloning the application and changing to its directory, youâ€™ll want to run
the setup script:

```
% bin/setup AppName app_name
```

This will:

- Install application dependencies
- Create your database
- Inject your app name into files where appropriate

Thatâ€™s all there is to it. Spin up a server on http://localhost:3000 and
start hacking:

```
% bin/rails server
```

## Overview

Boxcar is an opinionated collection of content management and software
development tools all bundled together and ready for you to start building
client sites on top of.

Itâ€™s powered by a some awesome open source projects:

- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), a web application framework
  that you may have heard of.
- [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), a flexible authentication
  solution for Rails.
- [Trestle](https://trestle.io/), a customizable admin framework that makes
  Rails content management a snap.
- [Webpacker](http://breakfast.devlocker.io/), a project that integrates the
  [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) build tool into your Rails project.

There are a handful of useful Ruby libraries included; check the Gemfile
to see whatâ€™s what.

Boxcar also comes loaded with some frontend libraries set up and ready for
action:

- [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Finally, some tools are configured and in place to help check your work:

- [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

## Deployment

Boxcar can easily be deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), assuming
you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
installed.

First, run `bin/heroku_setup your-app-name`; this script will set you up with
two Heroku apps (one for staging and one for production) with Heroku
PostgreSQL instances attached and in a development pipeline.

From then on, you can `bin/deploy` to deploy to staging and `bin/promote` to
promote the staging app to production.

## Contribute

PRs accepted, _however_ this is an admittedly opinionated framework based
on what I use at [work](http://theadvocate.com) to get projects built
quickly and with a high level of confidence. If youâ€™re looking to make big
changes to workflow or tooling you should fork the project.

If you do submit a PR, please adhere to the
